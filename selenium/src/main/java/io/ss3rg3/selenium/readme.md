Note that you need the following:

1. The Chromium binaries (Chrome is only available as `deb` package, but works as well)
2. An edited ChromeDriver (names of `cdc_*` variables replaced)
3. `ublock` extension as `.crx` file
4. You also need to configure the Chromium profile to make `ublock` work (first startup downloads the lists and you need to enable blocking of pop-ups and annoyances)
